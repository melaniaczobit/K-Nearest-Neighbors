# K-Nearest Neighbors 

Project: Predicting Heart Failure 

This project will utilize the k-nearest neighbours supervised classification algorithm to classify new data and predict the occurrence of heart failure in patients. The algorithm is simple and easy to implement. KNN can be used for classification or regression. However the drawback is that training a large dataset of predictors to determine the classification involves loading the whole dataset and using every point, requiring a large memory. Dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data).
